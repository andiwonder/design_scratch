            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>Wolters Kluwer is a global company that provides information, software, and services in healthcare, law, finance and tax. I am working with the team that provides Global Risk and Compliance software products and services to the Healthcare industry in North America and several other industries in Belgium and France.</p>
            <p>The task in hand was for a refresh of their existing suite of Risk and Compliance Software (ComplyTrack and Verifield) to accommodate for the growing needs utilizing the latest technologies. One of the key factors was to build all these products under a single platform that can be customized to every subscriber’s needs while allowing integration between the several products and also to create a consistent branding and user experience across all products in the platform.</p>

        <h4>Process</h4>
        <p>
          The first step was to understand the suite of products that were being added into the platform along with the interdependencies and the business timeline of when the products were scheduled to begin development. The next step was to gather the similarities in the products to setup the base requirements for the platform. With the base frontend framework, CSS and design patterns set for the common functionalities shared across the platform, we began conducting <strong>PreVis</strong> sessions for each product module that was being built.
        </p>
        <p>
          The different modules (Risk Assessment Manager, Incident Manager, Audit Management, Legal Register) were built with separate <strong>PreVis sessions</strong> for each module. The <strong>Lean Canvas
          </strong> was completed to help understanding the problem, Customer segments and other information’s which provide data to complete the Personas, Empathy Map and Experiment Map in those 4-day workshops with the stakeholders and development teams.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the problem in hand has been broken down and the constraints defined, the possible solutions were ideated. Then the list of features was narrowed down based on the technological and timeline feasibility of building and delivering the product on time. With this process done the last day and half was usually spent whiteboard sketching different ideas along with the stakeholders.
        </p>

        <p>
          Having created the rough sketches in the workshop, the next step was to collaborate with the Business Analyst’s to create the Baseline Requirement documents, stories and the detailed wireframes from the whiteboard sketches. Based on the research, user interviews, Subject Matter Experts interviews we would have an outline of what problems the existing users of the legacy products are having and understanding their needs from what they would like to see in the new software.
        </p>
        <img src="./images/wolters/wolters_2.png" class="img-fluid mb-3" alt="">
        <p>
          One of the major concerns was the tedious mental workload while using the products and the key goals was to reduce that. We began breaking down the processes into smaller screen chunks based on the process flow of the user and automating the process wherever possible. We also were incorporating the new branding guidelines onto the look and feel of the product creating a consistent pattern across all the transactional applications in our product suite.
        </p>
        <p>
          High level functioning prototypes were presented to the stakeholders and development team to gather feedback and complete final design modifications before giving out the detailed specifications for development and testing. Once the product has the functionalities built and tested over the several sprints, User Acceptance Testing was performed on the product to identify the gaps in designs and make changes before handing over the software for production.

        <h4>Results</h4>
        <p>
          Over several iterations from a whiteboard sketch, high level prototype to the developed product, the design was aligned to solve the user’s needs and to provide them with a seamless experience in using and utilizing the software product. The key takeaway for me from this project was being able to complete a complex legacy software refresh without compromising the user’s experience within the stipulated time. The redesigned product helped in retention of existing customers by improving user satisfaction and also generating new customers.

          <strong>Note:</strong> Most of this product is covered under NDA and limits the information I am allowed to share, I have tried to explain the process as briefly as I can. Please contact me if you would like to learn more about my process and methodologies.
