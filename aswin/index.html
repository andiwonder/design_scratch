          I'm Aswin, a New York City based user experience designer currently making products and experiences at Wolters Kluwer.       
        </p>
        <p>
          Design is my passion. Using the skills I have acquired over the years, I love creating new products or services iterating from a paper sketch to a fully functional product. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I was born and raised in Chennai, India, then moved to Coimbatore for high school and graduated from Anna University with a Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering. While pursuing my Bachelors, I developed the interest in designing posters, certificates, and invitations for product design in mechanical product solutions. Notably, during the 3rd year of my Bachelors I discovered the Human Factors and Ergonomics program in Clemson University and started working towards enrolling in their Master's program. During the Master's program, I learned the skills required to gather and understand user's requirements in order to design a seamless experience for any product or service.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have had the opportunities to create designs and experiences ranging from a website for a local pizza restaurant, a socializing app for students, optimizing the front-end process in a University Health Center, adding an e-commerce platform for a nutritional supplements company, and currently developing a platform of Global Risk and Compliance software.
        </p>

          In my spare time you can find me drumming, capturing photos and videos, building computers and gaming.

            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>Wolters Kluwer is a global company that provides information, software, and services in healthcare, law, finance and tax. I am working with the team that provides Global Risk and Compliance software products and services to the Healthcare industry in North America and several other industries in Belgium and France.</p>
            <p>The task in hand was for a refresh of their existing suite of Risk and Compliance Software (ComplyTrack and Verifield) to accommodate for the growing needs utilizing the latest technologies. One of the key factors was to build all these products under a single platform that can be customized to every subscriber’s needs while allowing integration between the several products and also to create a consistent branding and user experience across all products in the platform.</p>

      <div class="col-5 offset-md-1">
        <h4>Process</h4>
        <p>
          The first step was to understand the suite of products that were being added into the platform along with the interdependencies and the business timeline of when the products were scheduled to begin development. The next step was to gather the similarities in the products to setup the base requirements for the platform. With the base frontend framework, CSS and design patterns set for the common functionalities shared across the platform, we began conducting <strong>PreVis</strong> sessions for each product module that was being built.
        </p>
        <p>
          The different modules (Risk Assessment Manager, Incident Manager, Audit Management, Legal Register) were built with separate <strong>PreVis sessions</strong> for each module. The <strong>Lean Canvas
          </strong> was completed to help understanding the problem, Customer segments and other information’s which provide data to complete the Personas, Empathy Map and Experiment Map in those 4-day workshops with the stakeholders and development teams.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the problem in hand has been broken down and the constraints defined, the possible solutions were ideated. Then the list of features was narrowed down based on the technological and timeline feasibility of building and delivering the product on time. With this process done the last day and half was usually spent whiteboard sketching different ideas along with the stakeholders.
        </p>
        <img src="./images/wolters/wolters_1.png" class="img-fluid mb-3" alt="">
        <p>
          Having created the rough sketches in the workshop, the next step was to collaborate with the Business Analyst’s to create the Baseline Requirement documents, stories and the detailed wireframes from the whiteboard sketches. Based on the research, user interviews, Subject Matter Experts interviews we would have an outline of what problems the existing users of the legacy products are having and understanding their needs from what they would like to see in the new software.
        </p>
        <img src="./images/wolters/wolters_2.png" class="img-fluid mb-3" alt="">
        <p>
          One of the major concerns was the tedious mental workload while using the products and the key goals was to reduce that. We began breaking down the processes into smaller screen chunks based on the process flow of the user and automating the process wherever possible. We also were incorporating the new branding guidelines onto the look and feel of the product creating a consistent pattern across all the transactional applications in our product suite.
        </p>
        <p>
          High level functioning prototypes were presented to the stakeholders and development team to gather feedback and complete final design modifications before giving out the detailed specifications for development and testing. Once the product has the functionalities built and tested over the several sprints, User Acceptance Testing was performed on the product to identify the gaps in designs and make changes before handing over the software for production.

        <h4>Results</h4>
        <p>
          Over several iterations from a whiteboard sketch, high level prototype to the developed product, the design was aligned to solve the user’s needs and to provide them with a seamless experience in using and utilizing the software product. The key takeaway for me from this project was being able to complete a complex legacy software refresh without compromising the user’s experience within the stipulated time. The redesigned product helped in retention of existing customers by improving user satisfaction and also generating new customers.

          <div class="col-8 border-left">
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>
              Standard Process is a nutritional supplements company based out of Palmyra, Wisconsin. They manufacture nutritional supplements from freshly grown ingredients in their farm and sell it to the Health Care Practitioners who in turn prescribe and sell the supplements to their patients. I was roped in to be a UX designer and a frontend developer on their Patient Direct project.
            </p>
            <p>
              Patient Direct was an addition to their existing site where the patients would directly be able to purchase the supplements prescribed for them by their Health Care Practitioners from the site and Health Care Practitioners would be able to prescribe and monitor the supplements being purchased by their patients. The challenge was to add on an e-commerce module onto the existing site, create separate workflows for both the Health Care Practitioner and their patients under regulated trade policies.

        <h4>Process</h4>
        <p>
          The initial step was conducting stakeholder interviews to understand, define the scope and constraints of the project. Once the needs of the business side had been understood and metrics were created to analyze and measure the progress of the product. The initial process flow chart was created for the Health Care Practitioner and the Patients on their interaction with the site.  With the base process flow refined over several iterations we started the discussion with development team on setting up the technical architecture based on the process flow and also the limitations of constructing the module over an existing platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started designing the sketches and lo-fi wireframes based on the process flow and since the turnaround time from the design to finished front-end code was low I started performing Guerilla user testing and research with the Customer Service Representatives and Health Care Practitioners within the company who were interacting with the Health Care Practitioners and their Patients on a daily basis guiding them through the purchases and problems with it. This process not only saved time but also yielded valuable information to improve the design and experience for the end customers.

          One of the major issues discovered while interviewing the Health Care Practitioners was setting up the system in a way they can control what the patients can buy and monitor them to comply with regulations and prevent abuse. This lead to designing the system where the Health Care Practitioner gives a unique code to their patients, who can use the code to register and would be linked under the Practitioner to get prescribed supplements. The solution was a unified Patients Dashboard where they can Approve/Deny patients, prescribe and monitor supplements to the Patients under them.

      <div class="col-10 offset-md-1">
        <p>
          Another exception case was when a Patient Switches Health Care Practitioners, how to transfer the patient’s control to the new Practitioner. In order to maintain consistency with the initial registration process the patient would get the Code from their new Practitioner and enter that in the Switch Practitioner available for them and then it goes through the same process with the Practitioner reviewing and Approving/Denying the Patient from their Dashboard.

          The next step was designing the e-commerce module of the site where the patient can view/search for their prescribed supplements and order them. With the initial wireframes and prototypes in hand for the Patient ordering process we had setup two focus groups to conduct user testing on the prototypes before they were built for production to identify the issues which yielded great results and insights from the Patients that helped in refining their purchase experience. One of the features that was added after these sessions was segregating the prescribed products into separate tabs based on their category and adding in the “Previously Ordered” tab which reduced the time and eased the process of ordering to checkout. Another issue that was discovered was reconfiguring the Patient dashboard for increasing discoverability in finding their previous orders and tracking them or reordering them.

          The designs were perfected over few iterations and developed into deliverable front-end code for the back-end team to complete the plumbing work for the system to be tested. Once the issues and bugs were fixed and acquiring QA and stakeholder’s approval, another round of focus groups and individual user interviews were performed with internal and external Health Care Practitioners prescribing Standard Process products and their Patients using it. The system was tested and benchmarked against metrics initially created and added from the first round of testing. This process helped finishing the final tweaks for the site and ready for public deployment which included adding a Sales Tax Report generator for Health Care Practitioners.

          Finally marketing tools like Patient Brochure, Social Media announcement and Patient Email, Marketing Icons and FAQ’s were designed and published along with a Patient Direct guide for the Customer Service Representatives to help aid Health Care Practitioners and Patients with questions and issues with Patient Direct site.

        <h4>Results</h4>
        <p>
          Based on the results from the final testing against the metrics the site performed well above the benchmarked and ideal values set. The registration and ordering process was perceived to be simple and comfortable for the users based on the customer’s feedback. The pilot program of this project was expected to have 40 Health Care Practitioners and their patients signed up and ordering products within a month from the release and at end of a week from the release the system had close to 120 practitioners signed up with patients using the product. The clients, stakeholders and users were happy with the outcome of the product and I was able to take away the experience of designing a successful e-commerce product into production.
